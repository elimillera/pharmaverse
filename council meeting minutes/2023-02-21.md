# Meeting notes
- Welcomed Ari to council and shared opportunity for Novo colleagues (as well as any other org) to apply to join WGs
- Debriefed call with R Consortium rep:
  - Agreed that we should add more to our website around legal liability (i.e. people take responsibility as users of these packages, and there is no mandate - everyone makes a choice of whether to use any selections of packages within or beyond the pharmaverse list)
  - Planned to conform to some of the expected R norms (such as a CRAN task view and having a skeleton {pharmaverse} R package on CRAN - detailing how to navigate pharmaverse)
  - Need to clarify what pharmaverse is on our homepage: see open brainstorm at https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverse/discussions/192 and please anyone from our community add views
- Considered high level pros/cons of pharmaverse ever becoming affiliated with any industry group - such as risks of loss of autonomy or scope creep vs benefits of increased exposure and user reach
